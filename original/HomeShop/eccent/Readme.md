09/15/01	Need to turn an eccentric and don't have a four-jaw chuck (or don't want to set it up for a quick job)? Packing the work in the three-jaw will handle many jobs. This tool calculates the amount of packing needed. A more elegant method employing a slotted tube is also described along with a program for making the required calculations.
