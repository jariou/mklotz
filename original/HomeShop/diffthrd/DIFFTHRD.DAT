Available Thread Data for DIFFTHRD program

Enter all the thread pitches (in indicated units) which you have
the ability to cut - either via lathe or tap and die.
The default values shown here are what my lathe can cut.
If you want to exclude either Imperial or metric threads from consideration
in the calculation, simply remove the unwanted entries from this file.
Values need not be entered in order.
Program can handle up to 400 entries - if you need more contact me
via email at: mklotz@alum.mit.edu

Anything entered before the next line will be ignored by the program.
