	Let's say I have a 3" x 2" x 1/4" piece of metal and I want to round
off one of the 2" edges with a 1" radius.  I can't do the job on the lathe for
obvious reasons.  There can't be any holes in the finished product so I can't
conveniently pivot the workpiece against a cutter to form the radius.

	One approach is to rough out the radius on the milling machine using a
ball-ended mill.

	Assume:

		R = radius of desired profile (1" in the example)
		d = diameter of ball mill
		r = radius of ball mill = d/2
		theta = an angle (see below)

	Now assume the work is mounted in the vise with the 2" edge sticking up
and aligned with the x axis.  Assume the end of the ball mill is just touching
the (center of) the 2" edge.  Let theta be measured from the vertical about the
center of the radius to be cut.  Thus theta = 0 corresponds to the starting
position just described.  Now, it's easy to show that for some other value of
theta, the ball mill will just be tangent to the desired radius if its
position (i.e. the position of the center of the ball) is given by:

		x = (R+r) * sin(theta)  [=0 when theta=0]
		z = (R+r) * (1 - cos(theta))  [=0 when theta=0]

where z is measured positive downward from the starting position and x is
measured +\- along the x axis from the starting position.  So, if we step
theta by small amounts and make cuts with the tool positioned at the x,z
positions corresponding to each value of theta, we'll cut succesive "scallops"
into the workpiece, each of which is tangent to the required radius profile at
that angle.  If the increments in theta are small enough, the resulting
scallops will often be small enough to ignore.  If they're not, ten minutes
with a fine file will produce an acceptable finish.

	ROUNDER allows you to specify R, d, and the theta increment and
produces a file which contains a table of the values of:

		(R+r) * sin(theta)  [x in the example]
		(R+r) * cos(theta)
		(R+r) * (1 - sin(theta))
		(R+r) * (1 - cos(theta)) [z in the example]

	The second and third values above may seem superfluous but not
everyone may want to set up the cut as in my example.  As you try different
approaches, you'll find that being able to generate the other values is an
asset.  If you don't need them, just cross out their columns on the printed
copy of the data file that you carry to the shop.

	A good suggestion is to rough out the profile of the radius with
hacksaw or whatever so the ball mill doesn't have to chew through a lot of
material.  Just be sure to leave whatever starting reference point you're
going to use intact so you can accurately locate for the reference.
