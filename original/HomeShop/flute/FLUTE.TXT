One way to make tapered flutes (e.g., on an engine support column) is to tilt the workpiece and plunge cut with a ball mill.  As the cut progresses along the inclined workpiece, it becomes wider, thus forming the tapered flute.

The attachend drawing identifies the variables involved and the program computes the required initial depth of cut and the inclination angle.
