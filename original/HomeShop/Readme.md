A complete cutting list is produced and an ASCII data file allows easy tailoring to your problem. 2/14/02 added Mike Graham's much improved version of how to solve this problem - CUTLIST. Also included is REMNANT, which uses Mike's algorithm to solve the problem of how to optimize cutting of parts from random length remnants of available stock.
DALLOW.ZIP
(~28 Kbytes)
05/13/99	A friend wanted to drill a 0.5" blind hole 1" deep but didn't know how much to allow for the tapered end of the drill. Assuming you know the included angle of the drill tip (typically 2*59 = 118 deg) this will tell you how much to allow for the cylindrical part of the hole to be as long as needed.
DATA.ZIP
(~57 Kbytes)
04/04/06	Unlike most of the entries in this table, this is not a program but rather a collection of data files I've compiled over the years. I keep a copy of CHART.TXT lying on my workbench for constant reference. (I printed it with a Simtel utility that prints up to four pages of text on a single side of an 8.5 x 11" sheet!) How many threads per inch on a #6 woodscrew ? - you'll want to know if you make lathe chucks for your woodturning friends. I won't vouch for the accuracy of any of this data since I didn't research the files, but I doubt any of it is very far off the mark. BTW, I welcome any additions you can make to this selection - help other amateurs with data that's hard to find.

DIFFTHRD.ZIP
(~35 Kbytes)
12/23/99	Very fine threads are great for precise positioning and generating large torque advantages but one seldom has the gear to cut the threads and, once cut, they're very delicate. A more practical approach in many applications is to use a differential thread. This tool will tell you all you need to know to do it.
DIPSTICK.ZIP
(~26 Kbytes)
01/14/06	Dennis Blagirowicz wanted a program to help him to calibrate a dipstick to be used with a horizontal cylindrical tank. Given the tank diameter and length of wetting on the dipstick, this program calculates the fraction of total volume remaining in the tank. The program also includes similar calculations for spherical, elliptical and cartouche-shaped tanks. A recent update adds bucket and barrel shaped tanks. A further update covers horizontal cylindrical tanks with dished and hemispherical end caps.
DIVHEAD.ZIP

ECCENT.ZIP
(~39 Kbytes)
09/15/01	Need to turn an eccentric and don't have a four-jaw chuck (or don't want to set it up for a quick job)? Packing the work in the three-jaw will handle many jobs. This tool calculates the amount of packing needed. A more elegant method employing a slotted tube is also described along with a program for making the required calculations.
EGG.ZIP
(~44 Kbytes)
01/22/03	Make breakfast on your lathe? Well, sort of. In Nevil Shute's book, "Trustee from the Toolroom", he describes the making of (metal) eggs on the lathe. I wanted to explore the difficulties of doing that so I wrote this demonstration program, based on my PROFILE, to prove that it could be done. Since I doubt that very many people want to do this, the program is just a demonstrator, not a finished tool. Should anyone want to get into the metallic poultry field, contact me and I'll make it into a user modifiable tool.

06/03/06	Andy Pugh, UK, has compiled a table of ~400 "standard" threads arranged in order of size (from 10 Whitworth instrument (0.010" dia.) up to 6" Gas) identified by type. A very handy tool for identifying 'mystery' threads one might encounter - especially when dealing with British equipment. The list is a bit tiresome to search by hand if one is trying to identify an unknown thread. I wrote a program to search it using either major diameter or pitch as the search argument.
FITS.ZIP
(~32 Kbytes)
12/28/04	Machinery's Handbook devotes nearly fifty pages to the subject of various fits of a shaft to a hole. Tubal Cain's Model Engineers Handbook devotes less than half a page to the subject. For reasons that don't require elaboration, I took the latter data and incorporated it into an easy to use program (with data file for your amendments). Unless you're building super high precision equipment, I think you'll find it more than adequate.

OFFKEY.ZIP
(~77 Kbytes)
01/17/03	While the program name accurately describes my singing, this has nothing to do with music. If you have a cam keyed to a shaft and wish to change its phasing relative to the shaft by a few degrees, one way to do it is to make an OFFset KEY (hence the name). This program will provide the data you need to build such a key. Thanks to Ronnie Shultz for suggesting this tool and assisting in its design.

(~51 Kbytes)
08/10/01	The generalized form of BALLCUT.C, capable of incrementally cutting ANY user-specified, non-critical profile on the lathe. You specify part radius at intervals along the axis of the part and it generates a cutting schedule that approximates the part profile to whatever detail your patience will tolerate. (See also SPLINE, BALLCUT.)
PROTRAC.ZIP
(~72 Kbytes)
02/12/01	A sinebar is the preferred way to accurately set or measure an angle. On the other hand, a protractor is a very handy tool in a number of applications. Wouldn't it be nice if we could combine the accuracy of the sinebar approach with the convenience of the protractor? This discusses an attempt to do just that.
RATIO.ZIP
(~31 Kbytes)
02/23/05	There are so many rules these days, wouldn't you just know there's a rule for numbers? Seriously, if you need to make a graduated set of anything, the "American National Standard for Preferred Numbers" is what you need to design your set so as not to attract attention from some three letter government agency. This program will do all the hard mathematical work (yes, logarithms ARE used!) for you.
RATTLE.ZIP
(~29 Kbytes)
11/04/99	Need to measure a bore bigger than your calipers? Guy Lautard documents an old-timers' technique that works very well.

REVOLVER.ZIP
(~29 Kbytes)
08/09/00	Calm down, all you gun confiscation nazis. Go back to designing your liberal nirvanas. This has nothing to do with firearms. Rather it's a tool to do some calculations involved in building a clever (my take, anyway) type of small tool holder that makes it easier to identify which tool you're selecting.
ROTARY.ZIP
(~31 Kbytes)
04/16/99	Doing dividing? A hole-plate-vernier dividing head is nice, but with a (very) slight loss in accuracy, a rotary table (avoid backlash - go unidirectional) can handle ANY dividing problem. Just hope the vernier isn't calibrated in deg/min/sec (thankfully, mine isn't). If it is (or is properly divided into decimal fractions of a degree), this utility will take the headache out of calculating the settings for any desired number of divisions. (Data file to print and carry to shop.) People on the web actually sell software to do this calculation for $15 - an absurdity when one considers how trivial it is. I know they want to think they're being paid for the programming effort, but is ten minutes of programming worth $15 from every user? Clearly, I think not.
ROUNDER.ZIP
(~32 Kbytes)
02/23/05	This is a tool to assist in rounding over workpieces in the milling machine analogous to the method of BALLCUT for the lathe.
SINE.ZIP
(~50 Kbytes)

How to lay out a bolt circle of holes of various diameter such that the space between adjacent holes is constant. If the punches were all the same diameter, my REVOLVER program would do the job. With differing diameters the problem gets mathematically more complex. This tool sorts out all the nasty calculations.

12/12/01	In Southern California we don't get much call for computing wind chill temperatures unless we go skiing after a day at the beach (eat your heart out!). Surprisingly, I discovered that there's a formula for equivalent wind chill temperature. If you live where water can exist in the solid state outside a refrigerator, you might have use for it.
DEW.ZIP
(~20 Kbytes)
03/13/04	You can avoid rust causing condensation on your machine tools by arranging a means of warming them above the dew point temperature. This program will allow you to calculate the dew point temperature for your conditions. See also PSYCH.
DOOMSDAY.ZIP
(~32 Kbytes)
09/07/03	Amaze your friends! Convince them that you're an idiot savant and not the just-plain-idiot they've always thought you were. Win bar bets! Learn how to mentally determine the day-of-the-week for any date in the year. The instructions in the text file will tell you how to do it. The program is just there to prove that the scheme really works.
LATLON.ZIP
(~21 Kbytes)
03/21/02	Given the latitude and longitude of two points on earth, compute the great circle distance between them and the azimuth of each point as viewed from the other point.

03/06/99	Appends a copy of the current text screen to a file on the hard disk for future use. Read the .TXT file for a complete description. Very useful but written in assembler so may not work on every system.
PSYCH.ZIP
(~20 Kbytes)
03/14/04	No this isn't something to help with the voices you hear. It refers to a wet/dry bulb psychrometer used to measure relative humidity and dewpoint. This program provides the calculations needed to convert the measured temperature difference to the desired values. See also DEW.
SUN.ZIP
(~47 Kbytes)
04/15/04	Accurate computations of solar data - sunrise/set, local noon, equinoxes and solstices, altitude and azimuth, etc. as well as horizontal and vertical sundial angles and the equation of time. You'll need to adjust the lat/lon in the data file to your location on earth.

BOILERS.ZIP
(~50 Kbytes)
11/18/00	Gene Rutkowski has generously allowed me to add his model locomotive boiler design tool to the collection. Gene's program is in BASIC but that shouldn't be a problem.
BOLTLOAD.ZIP
(~275 Kbytes)
03/17/03	Another great submission by Richard Williams in the UK. This program is used to calculate the loads applied to individual bolts within a group of bolts when subject to a load applied to a rigid structure.
CHANGEJS.ZIP
(~91 Kbytes)
08/15/05	Jaring Siemensma, of the Netherlands, has written his own version of a program to calculate the change gears needed to cut a particular thread. While similar to my CHANGE program, his is a Windows program and displays a nice pictorial output. Folks with metric lathes may find this program more convenient to use although it does accommodate the cutting of Imperial threads.
CSK.ZIP
(~30 Kbytes)
02/15/99	B. Vaughan has written a neat tool for determining the drill/mill depth needed to obtain consistent and correct countersink diameters.
CUTTER.ZIP
(~33 Kbytes)
01/25/02	Johan (Joe) Smit of South Africa helped simplify the process of making cutters to make gears. He took the calculations from an article in "Model Engineers' Workshop" and incorporated them into a Visual Basic program.
EE.ZIP
(~25 Kbytes)
11/17/98	I do most of my computer work directly from the DOS command line. I often need to make a quick calculation and am too impatient to load the RPN calculator I built. I had long considered writing a command line Expression Evaluator so I could just type in something like EE 3+4*sin(37)/log(50) and get the answer immediately. Then I discovered that Mark Morley (of lovely Victoria in BC, Canada) had already written just what I needed. I made a few changes to tailor it to the way I think and am passing it along here. Technically, Mark did not submit this program to me but, after reading the included text file, I think you'll see that he has no reservations about disseminating it so long as he gets credit for his work. See also MATH.
GCODE.ZIP
(~524 Kbytes)
03/30/02	Oliver Smit, in South Africa, sent along his g-code writer. It's a Windows program, so a bit bigger than the other programs here but it seemed like something that would be very useful to many people. You specify the tool speeds, movements, etc. and it generates the correct g-codes, which can then be written to a file for export to the machine.
GEARING.ZIP
(~34 Kbytes)
02/14/01	Marv Windecker sent along a clever program for calculating variables associated with a gear driven vehicle. Enter any four of the following variables: axle ratio, engine rpm, vehicle speed, tire diameter, overdrive ratio. The program will then compute the unknown value.
KEYWAY.ZIP
(~92 Kbytes)
01/12/03	Another excellent B. Vaughan contribution to take all the pain out of calculating depths of cut for keyways and keyseats so they're correctly centered on the shaft-hub intersection line.
MATH.ZIP
(~21 Kbytes)
01/22/04	Dale Holt, of Colorado, sent along his command line mathematical expression evaluator. It includes the very handy ability to iteratively solve equations. Give it a try. See also EE.
OHM.ZIP
(~31 Kbytes)
02/17/99	I had intended to write an Ohm's law calculator for a while and B. Vaughan's contribution got me off the mark. You enter what you know and it calculates the unknown quantities. If the phase angle is known it will handle AC calculations.
PIPECON.ZIP

03/20/05	Martin Connelly, in the UK, sent along his program to convert pipe shapes from 3 dimensional XYZ coordinates to YBC bend data and vice versa.
PLATE.ZIP
(~138 Kbytes)
05/13/03	This program, submitted by Richard Williams, enables one to develop flat plates from the 3 dimensional boundary lines of a plate with curvature in one direction only (the X direction) - i.e. plates that have been draped over formers. This type of plate occurs in multi-chine boats.
RADIUS.ZIP
(~34 Kbytes)
01/16/04	An old trick for cutting a shallow groove of non-standard radius is to use a standard size milling cutter with radius less than the groove radius tilted to an appropriate angle. The calculations can be tedious but Steve Horace has worked the problem and sent along several approaches that make this operation easy. I've coded the two most difficult into this useful program.
SPRING.ZIP

03/16/05	Przemek Klosowski compiled a Windows version of the Linux units program for his Chesapeake Metalworking Society friends and passed it along to me as a possible alternative to my UNIT program.
Can You Help? [Goto Index]
A space to solicit information that better-informed-than-I readers might be able to supply. Beyond my own requests, I'll also echo legitimate, widely useful (i.e., no pleas for 19th century tool manuals, etc., please), reader requests here.

I've long wanted to write a simulation of a computer controlled milling machine so that I could experiment with CAM before actually investing in the hardware. Beyond the fun of 'arm chair machining', such a 'toy' would also be handy for planning complex hand-controlled milling operations and catching errors. On a lucky bookstore browse I found the book below. It answered most of my questions and it includes both CNC mill and lathe (DOS) simulators for developing and exercising G/M - code without ever getting a tool dull.

The ID (in) of a finger ring can be found from ID=0.032*R+0.458 where R is the ring size, e.g., size 6 ring has an id of 0.65 in.
The major diameter of a numbered thread (e.g. 6-32) is given by D=0.013*N+0.060 so a #6 has a major diameter of 0.138 in.
A rough way to calculate tap drill size (DRILL is much better) is to subtract the pitch (in units of length/thread) from the nominal diameter: 
1/4 (in) - 20 (tpi) => 1/4 (in) - 1/20 (ipt) = 0.2 in (#7 drill) 
6 x 1 mm => 6 - 1 = 5 mm
pi~=355/113 with an error of only 8.5E-6% (22/7 is in error by 0.04%)
A (US) penny is almost exactly 0.75" diameter.
A (US) nickel weighs ~5 grams.
A (US) dollar bill is (imprecisely) 2.5 x 6".
A (US) standard(?) business card is 2 x 3.5".
Zig-Zag cigarette paper is ~0.001" thick.
Metric length conversions aren't difficult. The (Imperial) inch is defined as exactly 25.4 millimeters. Memorize that number.
John Pagett of Birmingham, UK sent along a clever way of converting fractional inches to their metric equivalent. Keep doubling numerator and denominator until the denominator is 256. Then the numerator divided by ten is the equivalent in mm with an error of only 0.78% 
13/64 = 26/128 = 52/256 -> 52/10 -> 5.2 mm (correct value = 5.159375 mm) 
Steve Redmond points out that mm->in can be done approximately by multiplying by 4 and dividing by 100. 
30 mm * (4/100) =~ 1.2 in (correct value = 1.181)
Rule of thumb for milling cutters: depth of cut <= 0.5 * cutter diameter.
Stan Dornfeld sends along a handy relation he uses for calculating feeds when drilling:
d = drill diameter (in)
r = spindle speed (rpm)
f = feed (in/min)
f = d * r / 30
Quick way to compute allowance for standard 118 deg. drill tip: multiply drill diameter by 0.3
A one foot head of water exerts a pressure of 0.433 psi. A 2.309 feet head of water exerts a pressure of one psi.
The flow (GPM = gallons/minute) from a horizontal pipe of (inside) diameter d (in) can be estimated by measuring how far from horizontal the stream has dropped, y (in), at a distance x (in) from the end of the pipe and using the formula GPM = 2.56 * x * d * d / sqrt(y).
Most people, when they make homemade signs, make the letters way too small. A good rule of thumb is 2.5 to 3 inches of letter height for every 100 feet of viewing distance.
Tap drill size for a thread-forming tap can be found from:
tap drill = OD - 0.0068*(DOT)/pitch
For example, with a 1/4-20 tap and a desired depth of thread of 65%, we have:
tap drill = 0.25 - 0.0068*65/20 = 0.228 in. (#1 drill)
This one from Redgie Joy: 
When grinding cutting tools to an accurate profile it is difficult to prevent the layout from getting destroyed by the heat of grinding. Neither Dykem blue or magic marker stand up very well. Mix a dilute solution of Copper Sulfate (Blue Stone) and water. A couple of small lumps dissolved into water is fine. Add a drop or two of Sulfuric Acid (Battery Acid). The acid is not necessary, it just makes it work better. Degrease the toolbit, then paint a drop or two of the solution on the bit. It will immediately leave a thin coating of copper plate on the bit. Wash off in water, then scribe the profile in the copper plate. The copper will not burn off during heating, and since it is very thin, it is possible to engrave extremely fine lines.
The Imperial measurement system is hands-down one of the most nonsensical systems still used in (a few) industrialized countries. One of its most ludicrous examples is the system used for indicating the weight of an anvil. A triplet of numbers, e.g., a:b:c, is cast into or stamped onto the anvil. The first number is the number of hundredweights (cwt), the second number is the number of quarters (of a cwt), and the third number is pounds. Thus, the formula for the weight of the anvil in pounds is: 112*a + 28*b + c. The fact that a hundredweight is really 112 pounds and not 100 pounds has something to do with the British who thought eight stone 'looked' like about 100 lbs. Since a stone is 14 pounds, 8*14 = 112. Contact John Cleese at the Ministry of Funny Walks and Ridiculous Units for further information.
The full series of BA (British Association) threads runs from N=0 to N=22. The pitch of a given thread is given by P(mm)=(0.9)^N and its diameter is given by D(mm)=6 * P^(1.2). All BA threads have a thread angle of 47.5 deg.
The volume of a pizza of thickness 'a' and radius 'z' is given by pi z z a.
If you're going to check a micrometer for accuracy, it's important to use a set of gage blocks that cause the spindle to seat at different orientations so drunken thread errors will be noticed. The preferred set for inch micrometers is: 0.105, 0.210, 0.315, 0.420, 0.500, 0.605, 0.710, 0.815, 0.920, 1.000. For metric micrometers the preferred set is: 3.1, 6.5, 9.7, 12.5, 15.8, 19.0, 21.9, 25.0.

About the Author [Goto Index]
I'm a retired aerospace physicist living in Southern California whose hobbies include building model stationary (steam/vacuum/Stirling) engines from scratch. Over the years, I've written a number of programs that might be of use to other home shop machinists. The hobby magazines do not provide an appropriate medium for disseminating such tools, hence this web page. I hope that other home shop artisans who have developed useful computer tools will also set up pages like this. If they don't have the time or facilities to set up home pages, I'll be glad to consider submissions for this page. (Any submissions will be identified by author in the separate Submitted Software Table so that credit goes where credit is due.) I will not accept for profit submissions - this page is meant to be a location for freely sharing information of value to the amateur home shop community.

I reserve the right to edit, amend, correct spelling/grammar/content, etc. of anything submitted for reference on this page. And that's the limit of lawyer-speak you'll ever see here.

I welcome suggestions for utilities you might like to have me write that would have general (ok, almost any) appeal in the amateur metal/wood-working homeshop field. I can't guarantee anything but I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting programming tasks.
