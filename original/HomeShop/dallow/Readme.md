# DALLOW
05/13/99	A friend wanted to drill a 0.5" blind hole 1" deep but didn't know how much to allow for the tapered end of the drill. Assuming you know the included angle of the drill tip (typically 2*59 = 118 deg) this will tell you how much to allow for the cylindrical part of the hole to be as long as needed.
