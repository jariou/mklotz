	I was designing a flat belt power transmission system that used several
pulleys and needed to calculate the required belt length as well as the
required sizes for some cone pulleys that used an existing belt to obtain a
selection of operating speeds.

	BELT allows one to enter (via the ASCII data file) the x,y locations
of the pulleys (as many as 200) and their diameters and then attempts to
calculate the belt length needed.  If any pulleys overlap (presumably due to
user input error!) it will note that fact and exit.  If any of the pulleys are
"slack" (i.e., not contacted by the belt), it will note that error as well. 
Instructions for how to enter the data are given in the sample data file.

	If you have only two pulleys, it may be simpler and faster to use
QBELT, although two pulley problems can be solved using BELT.  QBELT doesn't
require a data file - all input is done directly on the screen.

	PULLEY is used to calculate the size of the second pulley in a two
pulley system when the belt length and pulley separation is already known.
PULLEY searchs for the unknown pulley diameter in the range between a tenth
and ten times the diameter of the known pulley with an accuracy controlled by
user input.  It's rare for pulley diameters to exceed a factor of ten in
relative size but, if that's required, contact me.

	Note that all the programs assume a flat belt system so no allowance
is made for the pitch diameter of the pulley, as would be necessary in the
case of V-belt pulleys.  Also, remember to use consistent units when
specifying dimensions (location, diameter, length, etc.).  The programs don't
presume the units used so they will work with any measurement system so long
as the units input are consistent.
