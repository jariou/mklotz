# Belt

While building a flat belt transmission system, I needed to calculate belt 
lengths and pulley sizes. The .zip file contains three programs. One to 
calculate belt length for an arbitrary arrangement of many pulleys, one 
to more quickly solve the same problem for two pulleys, and a third to 
calculate pulley size when the belt length is already set, as is the case 
with cone pulley speed changers.
