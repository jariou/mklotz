Data for CHANGE

data need not be in numerical order - program sorts before use

anything above the line below is ignored by the program

;NOTE: DATA MUST BE ENTERED IN ORDER SHOWN

;Maximum number of change gear pairs to examine in search.  Must be at least
;one and less than ten.  Large values will lead to excessive execution times. 
;Start with a value of two and, if you don't get a solution, increase
;in increments of one.

;Effective leadscrew pitch is the pitch of the thread that would be cut if
;the spindle and leadscrew were connected with 1:1 gearing.  For most lathes
;this is nothing more than the pitch of the leadscrew but oddball arrangements
;may exist.  If one is using a quick-change box in conjunction with a change
;gear banjo, then many "effective lead screw pitches" may be available.  Using
;a different "elsp" may allow one to get a required ratio with fewer change
;gear pairs as the default example shows.

;If your leadscrew is metric, enter its pitch as the equivalent threads/inch
;(tpi).  For example, a leadscrew of x mm/thread has a pitch of 25.4/x tpi.

; effective leadscrew pitch(es) (threads/inch)
; at least one must be entered

this is below the line and has no semicolon

Change gear data for other lathes or configurations can be stored here and
swapped into the data area when required.  No need to retype data once entered
into this file.
