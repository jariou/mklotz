Tired of running the lathe in reverse when cutting metric threads on a lathe with an Imperial leadscrew? Peter Lott, writing in Machinist's Workshop (6/01, vol. 14, no. 3) outlined a technique for getting around this annoyance. I programmed the calculations involved in his approach. As a bonus, the program also allows the technique to be applied to any combination of metric/Imperial leadscrew/thread-to-cut, a feature not covered in Peter's article.
