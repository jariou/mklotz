	John Rothen wrote me and asked:

Do you know of a program that will give the number of turns plus the number of
holes to count on a standard number plate for a dividing head with a non-
standard ratio, ie 90:1 or 100:1?

	I didn't know of any extant software.  In addition I use a rotary table
with a calibrated vernier handwheel rather than the hole plate style dividing
head so I wasn't familiar with the device in question.

	I decided the best solution was to write a program that would
(hopefully) work for any style dividing head using hole plate verniers.  I hope
I've gotten it right - if you find any errors I've made, alert me at my email
address - mklotz@alum.mit.edu.

	Dividing head calculations are logically straightforward.

	Define two INTEGERS:

	R = worm gear ratio (relative to 1)
	N = number of divisions of workpiece

	Then the number of turns of the crank (defined as T, and, in general,
not an integer) is given by R/N.  For example assume a typical 40:1 gear ratio
and a workpiece that needs to be divided into 14 segments.  With R=40 and
N=14, we get:

	T = R/N = 40/14 = 2.85714.....

	The program reduces 40/14 to 20/7 = 2 & 6/7.  Thus 2 full turns of the
crank are required plus 6/7 of a turn accomplished via one of the hole plates.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDING HEAD CALCULATIONS
 
Number of workpiece divisions [14] ?
 
DH Worm Gear Ratio = 40:1
Holes in rapid indexing plate on spindle = 24
Divisions of Workpiece = 14
Ratio/Divisions = 40/14 = 2.857142857
Turns required = 20/7 = 2 & 6/7
 
2 full turns of crank
and 18 holes on 21 hole plate
or  42 holes on 49 hole plate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	First, DIVHEAD reads a data file that describes the properties of the
dividing head in use - more on that file below.  It asks for the number of
divisions (14). It then calculates T (40/14) and reduces this to 2 & 6/7. The
'2' means that to step off 1/14 of a revolution you must first turn the crank
two full turns.  Then you need to turn the crank 6/7 of a turn using the hole
plates.  To do this you obviously need plates that have a number of holes that
is a multiple of seven.  From the data in DIVHEAD.DAT, the program knows that
this DH has a 21 hole plate and a 49 hole plate so either of those can be used
and it reports the number of holes to step on those plates in order to produce
6/7 of a crank turn.

	DIVHEAD.DAT looks like:

	You will need to edit this file to reflect the parameters that
describe the dividing head in question.  Note that, if your DH has a rapid
indexing plate on the spindle (used to simplify the dividing of small, oft
used number of divisions) you can specify it and the program will report in
terms of that plate when possible.  As an example, consider making six
divisions on a DH with a 24 hole rapid indexing plate:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDING HEAD CALCULATIONS
 
Number of workpiece divisions [14] ? 6
 
DH Worm Gear Ratio = 40:1
Holes in rapid indexing plate on spindle = 24
Divisions of Workpiece = 6
Ratio/Divisions = 40/6 = 6.666666667
Turns required = 20/3 = 6 & 2/3
 
Step 4 holes on rapid indexing plate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	For a 40:1 gear ratio, 6 & 2/3 turns of the crank is the same as
moving 4 holes on the rapid indexing plate.

	If a rapid indexing plate is not available, the same problem (6
divisions) would be reported as:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDING HEAD CALCULATIONS
 
Number of workpiece divisions [14] ? 6
 
DH Worm Gear Ratio = 40:1
No rapid indexing plate available
Divisions of Workpiece = 6
Ratio/Divisions = 40/6 = 6.666666667
Turns required = 20/3 = 6 & 2/3
 
6 full turns of crank
and 10 holes on 15 hole plate
or  12 holes on 18 hole plate
or  14 holes on 21 hole plate
or  18 holes on 27 hole plate
or  22 holes on 33 hole plate
or  26 holes on 39 hole plate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	If DIVHEAD can't find a solution using the available hole plates, it
will tell you what hole plate you need to manufacture:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDING HEAD CALCULATIONS
 
Number of workpiece divisions [14] ? 51
 
DH Worm Gear Ratio = 40:1
Holes in rapid indexing plate on spindle = 24
Divisions of Workpiece = 51
Ratio/Divisions = 40/51 = 0.784313725
Turns required = 40/51 = 0 & 40/51
 
NO SOLUTION USING AVAILABLE HOLE PLATES WAS FOUND
a plate with an integer multiple of 51 holes is required
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Obviously, DIVHEAD is set up to handle only simple indexing.  Compound
indexing (where both the crank and the hole plate are moved) mechanizations
seem to differ from one manufacturer to another and so generalizing the
mathematics doesn't seem possible.  If someone can prove me wrong on that
statement, I'll be glad to take a shot at a compound indexing program.

==============================================================================

	The problem of just which hole plates one NEEDS piqued my curiosity
and so I wrote a short program (DPLATES) to calculate what is needed as a
function of the gear ratio and the largest number of divisions one might
anticipate needing (no rapid indexing plate assumed).  It's offered here as a
'bonus' for those of you who might consider building a dividing head. Let me
know if I got something wrong.

	Below are some sample outputs with my annotations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED DIVIDING HEAD HOLE PLATES
 
DH worm gear ratio [40] ?
Maximum number of divisions needed [50] ?
 
Hole plates required for all divisions up to 50
4,5,6,17,19,21,23,27,29,31,33,37,39,41,43,47,49,

	It would appear that the 15 and 16 hole circles normally supplied with
commonly available devices aren't really needed to get the advertised "all
possible divisions up to 50".  Maybe it's done to make the low number plate
look better.  (You need the 20 hole plate for 4 and 5 and the 18 hole plate
supplies the 6.)
 
REQUIRED DIVIDING HEAD HOLE PLATES
 
DH worm gear ratio [40] ? 90
Maximum number of divisions needed [50] ?
 
Hole plates required for all divisions up to 50
3,5,13,14,16,17,19,22,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,49,

	One less plate with a 90:1 ratio to get everything up to 50.
 
REQUIRED DIVIDING HEAD HOLE PLATES
 
DH worm gear ratio [40] ? 100
Maximum number of divisions needed [50] ?
 
Hole plates required for all divisions up to 50
8,12,17,19,21,23,27,29,31,33,37,39,41,43,47,49,

	A 100:1 ratio doesn't save a lot of drilling effort.

REQUIRED DIVIDING HEAD HOLE PLATES
 
DH worm gear ratio [40] ? 60
Maximum number of divisions needed [50] ?
 
Hole plates required for all divisions up to 50
5,8,9,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,49,

	A 60:1 ratio is good because 60 is evenly divisible by a lot of
integers.

Update: 3/05

A number of folks have asked for a version of DIVHEAD which will generate a
complete table of 'turns and holes' for some input range of divisions.  The
idea is that they can then print this file and keep it in the shop with the
dividing head rather than having to run DIVHEAD each time.

DIVHEADT (the 'T' stands for Table) uses the same DIVHEAD.DAT file which the
user creates for DIVHEAD and asks for a maximum number of divisions.  It then
prints the table to a file (DIVHEADT.OUT) which the user can print.
