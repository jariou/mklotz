# DIVHEAD
03/06/05	John Rothen wanted software for computing turns and holes on a dividing head with a non-standard worm gear ratio. I wrote a program that can be customized via a data file for ANY dividing head configuration. Also includes a program to determine which hole plates you'll need to generate all the divisions up to some input number.
