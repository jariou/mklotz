	I wanted to make a conical flue for one of my Stirling engines. 
Technically, the flue was a frustrum of a cone - that's the shape you get when
you slice off the pointy end of a cone along a plane parallel to the base of
the cone.

	I needed to make a flat pattern which I would cut out of light sheet
metal and then roll to produce the required shape.  I wanted the edges to
overlap by a 1/4" so I'd have some material for silver soldering the frustrum
once rolled.

	The mathematics weren't obvious and I knew I'd never remember what I'd
done if I had to do it again - hence the program.

FLAT PATTERNS FOR CONICAL PARTS
 
small diameter of cone [3] ?
large diameter of cone [5] ?
height of cone [10] ?
overlap allowance for joining [0.25] ?
 
small diameter = 3.0000
small circumference = 9.4248
large diameter = 5.0000
large circumference = 15.7080
cone height = 10.0000
overlap allowance = 0.2500
 
included angle of pattern = 36.3915 deg
smaller radius of pattern = 15.0748
  chord of smaller radius = 9.5096
  arc length for smaller radius = 9.5748
larger radius of pattern = 25.1247
  chord of larger radius = 15.6911
  arc length for larger radius = 15.9580
length of edge = 10.0499
cone included angle = 5.7106 deg

	Mark a point on a piece of paper.  From that point swing an arc with
radius 15.0748.  Then swing another arc with radius 25.1247.  Draw a line from
that point to the left edge of the arcs.  Measure 36.3915 deg from the point
and draw another line.  Cut a piece of metal to match the area between the two
arcs and the two straight lines, roll it and you'll have the required frustrum
with the 1/4" overlap for soldering.
