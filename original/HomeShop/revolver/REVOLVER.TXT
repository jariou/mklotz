	I like revolver cylinder holders for sets of small tools (e.g.,
jeweler's screwdrivers).

	What's that you ask?  Imagine taking a cylindrical piece of wood or
metal and drilling some (off-axis) holes in it so it looks like a revolver
cylinder.  Fit it with a thin central shaft and stick that shaft into a heavy
base so the cylinder sits "up in the air" above the base with the cylinder
holes oriented vertically.

	Now, when you place your jeweler's screwdrivers in the holes, their
tips will be visible in the space between the bottom of the cylinder and the
top of the base.  You can select the one you need easily.  The tools stay
together and it's easy to move them as a unit.

	I've used this trick for enough of my tiny tools that I finally wrote
a short program to sort out the calculations for making the (revolver)
cylinder.
