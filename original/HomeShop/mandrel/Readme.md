# MANDREL
07/03/13	If you wind your own springs, you know that sizing the mandrel for winding is generally done by guesswork. Kozo Hiraoka, writing in HSM, has produced a formula for calculating the required mandrel size that should help to get you close. I coded his formula to make it easier to use. See also SPRING.
