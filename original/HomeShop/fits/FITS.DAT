Data for FITS program (Shaft/Hole fit computation)

Entries are:   fit name,constant,allowance
constant is measured in thousandths of an inch
allowance is measured in thousandths of an inch per inch of shaft diameter
Example:  For a push fit on a nominal 1" shaft, machine the hole to exactly
1.0000", and machine the shaft to -0.35*(1.0)-0.15 = -0.5 thou less than the
nominal size (0.9995").
