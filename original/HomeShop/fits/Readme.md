12/28/04	Machinery's Handbook devotes nearly fifty pages to the subject of various fits of a shaft to a hole. Tubal Cain's Model Engineers Handbook devotes less than half a page to the subject. For reasons that don't require elaboration, I took the latter data and incorporated it into an easy to use program (with data file for your amendments). Unless you're building super high precision equipment, I think you'll find it more than adequate.
