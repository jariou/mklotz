# DIPSTICK
01/14/06	Dennis Blagirowicz wanted a program to help him to calibrate a dipstick to be used with a horizontal cylindrical tank. Given the tank diameter and length of wetting on the dipstick, this program calculates the fraction of total volume remaining in the tank. The program also includes similar calculations for spherical, elliptical and cartouche-shaped tanks. A recent update adds bucket and barrel shaped tanks. A further update covers horizontal cylindrical tanks with dished and hemispherical end caps.
