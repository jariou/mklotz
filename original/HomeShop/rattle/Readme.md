11/04/99	Need to measure a bore bigger than your calipers? Guy Lautard documents an old-timers' technique that works very well. I wrote a program to examine its operation and calculate the actual bore diameter. Also, if you have trouble measuring accurately with internal calipers, you should become familiar with this procedure.
