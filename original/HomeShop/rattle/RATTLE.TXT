	In his book, "Home Machinist's Bedside Reader #1 (pg. 11)", Guy
Lautard describes a technique for measuring a large bore when you don't have a
set of calipers large enough to span the diameter.

	Basically, you cut a "stick" to a length slightly less than the
diameter of the bore and provide it with rounded or pointed ends.  Inserted in
the bore, this stick will "rattle" back and forth a (hopefully small) amount. 
You measure the peak-to-peak rattle and then use a formula to calculate the
actual diameter.  Lautard gives a formula but it looks like an approximation
to me - although I haven't examined it closely.

	If the rattle distance is small compared to the diameter of the bore,
the stick length itself is a very accurate approximation of the bore diameter.

	I wrote RATTLE.EXE to accurately compute the diameter given the stick
and rattle lengths in order to evaluate this procedure.  You can use it to
calculate the diameter if you need to use this procedure.

	BTW, this is the way I was taught to use internal calipers.  If you
try to set the calipers to the actual diameter, you're very likely to spring
them slightly.  When withdrawn from the bore to be measured, they will
unspring slightly thus affecting the reading.  Better to set them so they
"rattle" slightly in the hole and then measure them.  RATTLE will prove to you
that, if you make the rattle very small, the difference between the measured
caliper distance and the actual diameter will be very small indeed.
