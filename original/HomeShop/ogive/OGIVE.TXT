An ogive is the shape formed by the pointed Gothic style arches.  It is formed
by the intersection of two circular arcs such that a sharp point is formed at
the point of intersection.  Of more application to metalworkers, 'ogive' is
also used to describe the three dimensional shape typical of a rocket nose
cone.  It's cross-section has the same mathematical description as the Gothic
arch.

I wanted to turn such a shape on a nose cone for a (non-functioning) "rocket"
for a neighborhood child, so I wrote this program.  In the same manner as
PROFILE, it allows the user to develop an incremental cutting schedule for
roughing out the ogive shape, which is then finished by filing, sanding, etc..

In the data file specify the diameter and length of the ogive as well as the
details of tool, stock and step size.  The program will take it from there.

For the mathematically inclined, a nice treatment of the mathematics of the
ogive can be found at:
