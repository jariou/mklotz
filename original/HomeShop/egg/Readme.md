# EGG
01/22/03	Make breakfast on your lathe? Well, sort of. In Nevil Shute's book, "Trustee from the Toolroom", he describes the making of (metal) eggs on the lathe. I wanted to explore the difficulties of doing that so I wrote this demonstration program, based on my PROFILE, to prove that it could be done. Since I doubt that very many people want to do this, the program is just a demonstrator, not a finished tool. Should anyone want to get into the metallic poultry field, contact me and I'll make it into a user modifiable tool.
