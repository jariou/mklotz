# VREV
I wanted to make a holder for some punches of varying diameter. Picture a revolver cylinder where each chamber is bored for a different caliber cartridge. How to lay out a bolt circle of holes of various diameter such that the space between adjacent holes is constant. If the punches were all the same diameter, my REVOLVER program would do the job. With differing diameters the problem gets mathematically more complex. This tool sorts out all the nasty calculations.
