	It seems a lot of people have difficulty calculating the weight of an
object by calculating the volume and multiplying by the density of the
material of which it is made.

	WEIGHT takes the pain out of doing just that.  The data file
(WEIGHT.DAT) contains approximate densities for some common materials.  You can
add/subtract to that file using an ASCII editor.

	After selecting the material of choice or inputting a known density
value, you can select one of the available shapes, specify the relevant
dimensions, and WEIGHT will calculate the volume and the resulting weight for
the selected material.  Alternately, if you know the volume a priori, that can
be entered directly.

	If I've left out your favorite shape, send me the formula for the
volume and I'll add it.  Note that many complex shapes can be "subdivided" into
simpler shapes, the weights calculated separately and then summed for the final
weight.  To this end, WEIGHT maintains a running total of the volumes and
weights calculated in a particular session.  After the weight/volume of the
current shape is calculated the user is prompted to enter a factor indicating
how many of the currently calculated weights/volumes should be added to the
running total.

For example, suppose you want to calculate the weight of a cylindrical tank
with flat ends.  Use shape number '3' (cylindrical pipe) to calculate the
weight of the tank body.  When prompted, add one (the default) of these shapes
to the running total.  Now use shape number '2' (cylindrical solid) to
calculate the weight of one of the ends.  When prompted, add two of these
shapes to the running total.  At this point the running total is the total
weight of the tank.
