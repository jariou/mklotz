# FINDTHRD
06/03/06	Andy Pugh, UK, has compiled a table of ~400 "standard" threads arranged in order of size (from 10 Whitworth instrument (0.010" dia.) up to 6" Gas) identified by type. A very handy tool for identifying 'mystery' threads one might encounter - especially when dealing with British equipment. The list is a bit tiresome to search by hand if one is trying to identify an unknown thread. I wrote a program to search it using either major diameter or pitch as the search argument.
