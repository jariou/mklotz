	A common metal work operation involves cutting a regular polygonal
tenon on the end of a shaft.  Most frequently, the tenon is square or
hexagonal.

	I generally do this by mounting the cylindrical stock in a Spindex on
the milling machine.  Zero the cutter against the stock surface, then lower it
by the required depth-of-cut (doc).  Take a cut, rotate the Spindex by the
required angle, cut and repeat these operations until the tenon is formed.

	Calculating the required doc when the tenon has an even number of
sides is relatively straight-forward but recently I wanted to make a
pentagonal tenon to serve as an "Allen key" to remove some tamper-proof bolts.
Tenons with an even number of sides are easily specified by the "across flats"
measurment but, with an odd number of sides that's not easily done with
accuracy.  A better procedure is to specify the diameter of the circle that
just circumscribes the required tenon polygon.  Formulas that relate diameter
of inscribed and circumscribed circles to other properties of regular polygons
are available in most mathematics handbooks.

	The program will calculate the required doc (and Spindex rotation
angle) given the size of the stock, number of sides on the polygon, and either
the distance across flats (for even sides) or diameter of circumscribing
circle (for odd sides).  It does no checking for idiocy.  If you want to cut a
1" across flats hexagon on a piece of 0.25" diameter stock, you need more help
than any program can ever supply.
