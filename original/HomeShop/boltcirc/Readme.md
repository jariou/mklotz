# Boltcirc

It's often easier and more accurate to lay out holes on a boltcircle with 
x-y coordinates than to scribe and step off the circle, especially if the 
number of holes is an unusual number. This program does the work and 
generates a table which you can print and carry to the drill press for 
reference. See also CHORD.
