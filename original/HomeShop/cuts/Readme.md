# CUTS
03/08/02	Solves the problem of how to cut many pieces of various lengths from stock that comes in standard lengths (e.g., pipe, lumber) with minimum waste. A complete cutting list is produced and an ASCII data file allows easy tailoring to your problem. 2/14/02 added Mike Graham's much improved version of how to solve this problem - CUTLIST. Also included is REMNANT, which uses Mike's algorithm to solve the problem of how to optimize cutting of parts from random length remnants of available stock.
