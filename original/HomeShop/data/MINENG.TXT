Ted Edwards, in Canada, published some minimum thread engagement data on the
Usenet news group.  I've reproduced his article below.

I added another column to Ted's original data.  The factor 'F' is:

		F = LE3/diam

I've seen 'rules-of-thumb' that state that minimum thread engagement should be
equal to the diameter of the bolt.  From Ted's data, that would be adequate for
the LE1 case where the nut and bolt are the same strength.

On the other hand, I've seen rules that say minimum thread engagement should be
1.5 times the diameter (or, equivalently, an 'F' factor of 1.5).  Again, from
Ted's data, that would appear to be a reasonable rule to use that would cover
both the LE1 and LE3 cases.

diam is nominal diameter (inches)

ETA is Effective Tension Area (square inches)

Length of Engagement (LE) is the length (inches) of thread engagement in 
nut (or tapped hole) such that the bolt will break before the threads 
strip.

LE1 is the LE assuming bolt and "nut" are the same strength.

LE3 is the LE assuming the bolt is three times as strong as the nut.
  e.g. Grade 5 bolt into mild steel or 6061-T6 Aluminum

These values have worked for me in the cases I've tried but I give no 
guarantees.  Use at your own risk.
