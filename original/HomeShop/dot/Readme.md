06/12/05	I don't cut a lot of threads on the lathe and I confess to being confused by the myriad designations in Machinery's Handbook. This tool computes depth-of-thread (absolute and with compound at angle) for all the combinations of sharp/flat roots/crests for the 60 deg. Unified thread form and can also be used for other thread forms (e.g., Whitworth).
