For two gears to mesh properly, the pressure angles of the two gears must be
the same.  On older equipment, the pressure angle was *usually* 14.5 deg.  On
more modern equipment it is *usually* 20 deg. [25 deg is used also but is less
common.]

Measuring pressure angle in a home shop environment is problematic.  One needs
either gear racks of known pa, gear gages, or an involute measuring machine. 
None of these devices are likely to be found in the typical hobbyist's shop
unless he does a lot of gear work.

This program is an experiment to see if I could provide some mechanism for the
HSM, devoid of a gear gaging equipment arsenal, to distinguish between 14.5
and 20 deg pa gears, the most common types.

Machinery's Handbook, under 'Checking Gear Sizes', lists a formula for the
chordal span, measured across several teeth. [In my 23rd edition, this is on
pg. 1977].  Even for gears of the same number of teeth and diametral pitch,
this measurement differs as a function of the pressure angle.

Given this difference, I think it would be possible to use it to differentiate
between the two common pressure angles.  [This is a SWAG on my part and
remains to be proved by those of you who use this program].

When run, the program requests the number of teeth and diametral pitch of the
gear, then produces an output that looks like:

-------------------------------- 
GEAR PRESSURE ANGLE BY MEASUREMENT OF CHORDAL SPAN
 
Number of teeth on gear [30] ?
Diametral pitch of gear [6] ?
 
Pressure angle = 14.50 deg...Chordal span over 3 teeth = 1.2941 in
Pressure angle = 20.00 deg...Chordal span over 4 teeth = 1.7921 in
-------------------------------- 
 
Use your calipers to measure across THREE teeth on the gear.  If the
measurement is close to 1.2941 in, you probably have a 14.5 deg pa gear.
OTOH, if you measure across FOUR teeth and get 1.7921 in, it's probably a 20
deg pa.

The difference in the two measurements can be quite small, e.g.:

-------------------------------- 
GEAR PRESSURE ANGLE BY MEASUREMENT OF CHORDAL SPAN
 
Number of teeth on gear [30] ? 18
Diametral pitch of gear [6] ?
 
Pressure angle = 14.50 deg...Chordal span over 2 teeth = 0.7765 in
Pressure angle = 20.00 deg...Chordal span over 2 teeth = 0.7800 in
-------------------------------- 

so the measurements must be made carefully.

If you are able to successfully use this program to distinguish pressure
angles, please drop me an email (mklotz@alum.mit.edu) to include in this text
file.  If it doesn't work, I'll be glad to include your complaints.  If you
have any suggestions for a better way to solve this problem, send them along.
