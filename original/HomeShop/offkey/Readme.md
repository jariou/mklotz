# OFFKEY
01/17/03	While the program name accurately describes my singing, this has nothing to do with music. If you have a cam keyed to a shaft and wish to change its phasing relative to the shaft by a few degrees, one way to do it is to make an OFFset KEY (hence the name). This program will provide the data you need to build such a key. Thanks to Ronnie Shultz for suggesting this tool and assisting in its design.
