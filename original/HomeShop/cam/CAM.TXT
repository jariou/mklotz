	Default inputs shown in []'s produce an example for a cycloidal cam
with 1.625 base circle, 1.25 stroke (cam rise) occuring over 120 deg. of cam
rotation.  Your inputs will override the default inputs.  The data needed to
cut the cam is output to the file CAM.DAT in the default directory.  Note that
the program assumes that the cam follower axis of motion passes through the
center of rotation of the cam. When the cam shape is plotted, the green curve
shows the follower displacement and the blue curve shows the follower
velocity.  The magenta curve represents the follower acceleration.  The red
circle is the base circle and the yellow curve describes the shape of the cam
where it departs from the base circle.  It is assumed that the cam rotates
about the center of the base circle.

	If the velocity curve has a sharp corner (e.g., straight-line and
parabolic), that means that the acceleration (derivative of the velocity) of
the riser at that point in the cam motion is infinite and that can cause
chatter and/or vibration.  Ideally, the velocity curve should be smooth with
no abrupt changes in slope.  That is why cycloidal cams are recommended. 
However, for less critical applications, the other forms of cams may be easier
to construct.

	Note that the program specifies no units (except for angles, which
must be in degrees) for the data input.  Use any consistent units you desire. 
You can design metric cams just as easily as English.
