# SINE
05/16/01	A simple and accurate way to make sine bars for machining precise angles is to use two cylinders of unequal diameter held at a fixed distance. This program provides all the machinery to make the needed computations and estimate the error in the resulting angle. A second program removes the need for making the separating link in favor of an approach that uses two butted cylinders of differing diameters.
