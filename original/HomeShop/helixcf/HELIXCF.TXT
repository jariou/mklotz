Chuck Fellows, a gifted model maker in Texas, has devised a really clever way for model engineers to make helical gears in the home shop.

A full description, including pictures, of his method can be found at:

With Chuck's permission, I've incorporated his calculations into a program to make things easy for other model engineers who wish to use his method.
