Most of us are familiar with the process of angling the compound slide so that
a given movement of the slide produces a lesser movement of the tool towards
the work.  For instance, if the compound is angled 30 degrees to the lathe
centerline, a movement of x, measured on the slide graduated dial, will move
the tool a distance of x/2 towards the work.  This, in turn, means that the
slide graduated dial now reads directly in diameter reduction of the work. 
Dialing in x will reduce the *diameter* of the work by x.

Another popular trick is to set the compound at an angle such that the infeed
movement to slide movement ratio is 0.1.  That way the graduated dial will read
directly in 0.0001" of tool movement.

This (terribly simple) program lets you enter the desired ratio:

		infeed movement/slide movement

and calculates the angle required to achieve that ratio.  Note that the ratio
must be less than one - the program will ding you if you try to use something
greater than one.

Lathe manufacturers aren't consistent about how they calibrate the compound
protractor so you may actually need to set the complement of the angle on the
protractor.  For your convenience, the program prints out the complement.
