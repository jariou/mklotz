For linear expansion, the relevant equation is:

	dlength = rho * length * deltat

where:

	length = nominal length of object (in)
	dlength = change in nominal length (in)
	rho = coefficient of linear thermal expansion (ppm/degF)
	deltat = change in temperature (degF)

The values reported for rho in the literature vary all over the map.  I've
tried to average values from a number of sources to get representative numbers.
However, for precise work, the user is encouraged to obtain an accurate value
for his particular material and enter that via the user option supplied. 
Alternatively, the number can be entered into the data file as a new entry and
used that way.
