Data for PROFILE.C

Simpler example:
	no spline fits - all linear interpolation
	diameter specified rather than radius and compensated by setting
	scaler=0.5

anything above the line below is ignored
STARTOFDATA


ds=1.000			;stock diameter
toolt=1			;tool type (1 = square tipped, 0 = round tipped)
wt=0.05			;tool tip width (ttype=1) or diameter (ttype=0)
dxd=0.05			;axial stock cutting increment
scalex = 0.25			;x axis scale factor
scaler = 0.5			;radius scale factor

;x is measured positive from end of stock (which is defined as x=0)
;r is RADIUS (not diameter) of stock at point x
;if using diameter values is easier for you, divide the value used for scaler
;by two.
