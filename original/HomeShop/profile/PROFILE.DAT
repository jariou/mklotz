Miniature tool handle


Any measurement system is ok, but be consistent.

ds=0.125		;stock diameter
toolt=1			;tool type (1 = square tipped, 0 = round tipped)
wt=0.036		;tool tip width (ttype=1) or diameter (ttype=0)
dxd=0.005		;axial stock cutting increment
scalex = 0.015625	;x axis scale factor
scaler = 0.015625	;radius scale factor

;x is measured positive from end of stock (which is defined as x=0)
;r is RADIUS (not diameter) of stock at point x
;if using diameter values is easier for you, divide the value used for scaler
;by two.
