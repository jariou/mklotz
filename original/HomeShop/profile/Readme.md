# PROFILE
08/10/01	The generalized form of BALLCUT.C, capable of incrementally cutting ANY user-specified, non-critical profile on the lathe. You specify part radius at intervals along the axis of the part and it generates a cutting schedule that approximates the part profile to whatever detail your patience will tolerate. (See also SPLINE, BALLCUT.)
