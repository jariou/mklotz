	Seems like whenever I want to measure or mix something, all the
available containers are bucket shaped.  By bucket shaped I mean shaped like a
frustrum of a cone - the figure that remains if you slice the pointy end of a
cone off with a cut parallel to the base of the cone.

	Cylindrical containers are better.  Since their cross-section is
constant over their length, they can be divided into n parts easily just by
marking off n divisions on their height.  You can't do that with buckets
because the cross-section varies with height.

	Moreover, all the mathematical formulas for a frustrum use the height
measured vertically from the base, not the slant height measured along the
sloping side of the container.

	Wouldn't it be nice to know what slant heights to mark off to divide a
bucket shaped container into n parts?  That's exactly what BUCKET calculates.

	Note that no units are called out for the input dimensions.  The
calculations are valid for any (consistent) set of length units and the volume
will be in units of the cube of the length unit.

	Note that, if the bucket has substantial wall thickness, the
measurements should be made on the inside of the bucket for accuracy since the
wall thickness is not accounted for in the calculations.
