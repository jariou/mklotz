In Machinist's Workshop magazine, June/July 2004, Vol. 17, Number 3, John Way
suggests a technique for making collets to accept square or hexagonal stock.
Lacking the suitable broaches, he bores a cylindrical hole in the collet, then
makes a number of saw cuts equal to the number of sides on the stock - four
slots for square stock, six slots for hex stock.

In use, the corners of the stock fit into the slots and the curved surfaces of
the cylindrical bore clamp down on the faces of the stock.  Not as secure as a
proper square or hex collet but adequate for light work.

John supplies an equation for calculating the size of the required bore as a
function of the number of polygon sides, the across flats dimension of the
stock and the slot width.  

I wrote a short program to implement this equation so I could try some test
cases in my own shop.  HSMs who are dumbfounded by equations may find this
progrm useful so I'm putting it on my site.

Note that the program allows one to specify any number of sides for the
polygon.  This despite the fact that John only addressed four and six sided
stock.  The equation is only valid for stock with an even number of sides. 
Octagonal stock is a possibility although cutting eight slots is probably the
practical upper limit of what's possible.  IOW, your answer to the first
question the program asks should be either 4,6 or 8.
