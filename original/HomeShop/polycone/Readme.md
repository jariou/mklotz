# POLYCONE
07/08/03	A polycone (my terminology) is a 3D figure with regular polygon base and facet-like triangular faces that meet at a central point to form a conical shape with flat sides. Tetrahedrons and pyramids are examples. This program calculates most of the dimensions and angles associated with such a shape.
