People keep asking me questions about the geometry of 'polycone' shapes.  The
name is my own invention since I don't know of any generic mathematical name
for such shapes.  I'm referring to three dimensional figures whose
base is a regular polygon and whose sides are equilateral triangles all of
which meet at a point.  A tetrahedron is a three-sided polycone.  A pyramid is
a four-sided polycone.  Frequently stained glass lampshades are frustrums of
polycones.

This program will calculate most of the relevant lengths and angles associated
with such figures if given:

		the number of sides
		the length of one side of the polygonal base
		the perpendicular height of the polycone, i.e., the height
		  measured from the center of the base to the cone tip

If I've left out some dimension you need to know, contact me and I'll add it.
