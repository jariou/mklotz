# Ballcut

You don't need to buy/build a ball cutting attachment for your lathe if you 
only need to cut occasional, non-critical spherical shapes. This little 
program will give you a printable incremental cutting schedule that gets 
the job done fast. Guy Lautard documents this technique but I was using it 
long before he documented it. The tables in his publications limit one to 
certain pre-determined ball diameters. This program will produce a tailored 
cutting schedule for any diameter. BTW, this type of machining is referred 
to as HAM (Human Assisted Machining)! See also PROFILE.
