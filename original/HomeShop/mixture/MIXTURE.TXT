	MIXTURE allows one to calculate mixture variables and dilutions. 
Dilutions are treated as mixing a solution with another solution that has a 0%
concentration of the active ingredient.

	Several comments are in order.

	First, concentrations should be specified in consistent percentages. 
If you specify the first concentration as Ca % (by volume) then it's only
logical to specify the concentration of the second solution by volume.  If
specifying concentrations by weight the same constraint of consistency
applies.

	Second the 'amounts' should have consistent units - with each other
and with the concentrations specified.  If specifying concentration by volume
then use a consistent set of volume units.  If by weight then use weight
units.  The program indicates no 'amount' units in its answers - the
appropriate unit is assumed to be the one you used in inputting data.

	Third, the program makes no attempt to check for all the forms of
idiocy possible with such a calculator - if you try to mix up a 50% solution by
diluting a 10% reagent and get a stupid answer or the program hangs up, that's
your problem, not mine.
