One way to measure a dovetail is to put cylindrical pins into the angles of the
dovetail and measure across the pins.  Knowing the dovetail angle and the
diameter of the pins, it is then possible to derive the measurements across the
top and bottom of the dovetail.

This program implements the calculations for this operation.

Any type of units may be used for the inputs so long as the user is consistent
and doesn't mix units.  Output units will be the same as the input units used.
